JUnit tests were included as well.

Two different server/client pattern:
TCP server and client: the client can ask the server to add a location onto a google map by giving the longitude, latitude, location name and description
UDP server and client: the client can register to the server to recieve notifications if there is anything change on the map.

For further implementation, multicast, asynchronized server were being used.
